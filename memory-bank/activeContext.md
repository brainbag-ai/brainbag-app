# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Optimizing the RAG system to improve relevance and efficiency
- Refining how chat messages are stored and retrieved for context
- Ensuring only user messages are used for RAG context retrieval
- Fixing issues with the Inngest AI-Kit implementation
- Ensuring proper communication between the chat interface and Inngest functions

## Recent Changes
- Fixed issues with the Inngest chat implementation:
  - Resolved React hooks order violation in the Chat component
  - Fixed polling mechanism to properly handle Inngest responses
  - Updated Inngest function to include better error handling and logging
  - Added timeout mechanism to prevent UI from getting stuck
  - Ensured proper response display in the chat interface
- Modified the RAG system to store only user messages in the chunks table
- Updated the createMessage function to filter messages by role
- Maintained all messages in the chat record while optimizing the chunks table
- Documented the changes in the memory bank
- Updated the system prompt to inform the AI that all user messages are being recorded and can be retrieved for context

## Next Steps
- Continue refining the Inngest AI-Kit implementation
- Explore streaming response options with Inngest
- Complete memory bank initialization with progress.md
- Create .clinerules file to capture project intelligence
- Explore the codebase in more detail to refine documentation
- Understand the specific AI integration and RAG implementation
- Examine the database schema and authentication system
- Review the chat interface components and functionality
- Document the new cleanup command in the memory bank

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Documentation is based on initial analysis of the project structure
- Further exploration of the codebase will be needed to validate assumptions
- The memory bank will need to be updated as more information is gathered
- Special attention should be given to the AI integration and RAG middleware
- Understanding the database schema will be important for future work
- The authentication system will need to be examined for security considerations
- File processing capabilities, especially PDF handling, should be explored
- **Package Installation**: Must use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` due to peer dependency conflicts

## Current Questions
- How can we implement streaming responses with Inngest AI-Kit?
- What's the best way to handle Inngest function completion status?
- What specific AI provider is being used?
- How is the RAG middleware implemented?
- What is the database schema structure?
- How is authentication handled?
- What file types are supported for upload and processing?
- How are conversations stored and retrieved?
- What is the deployment strategy for the application?

## Immediate Tasks
- Complete the memory bank initialization
- Explore key components of the codebase
- Update documentation with findings
- Identify any missing or incomplete aspects of the project

# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial memory bank setup for the project
- Understanding the project structure and components
- Documenting the system architecture and technologies

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank directory and core documentation files
- Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context

## Next Steps
- Complete memory bank initialization with progress.md
- Create .clinerules file to capture project intelligence
- Explore the codebase in more detail to refine documentation
- Understand the specific AI integration and RAG implementation
- Examine the database schema and authentication system
- Review the chat interface components and functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Documentation is based on initial analysis of the project structure
- Further exploration of the codebase will be needed to validate assumptions
- The memory bank will need to be updated as more information is gathered
- Special attention should be given to the AI integration and RAG middleware
- Understanding the database schema will be important for future work
- The authentication system will need to be examined for security considerations
- File processing capabilities, especially PDF handling, should be explored
- **Package Installation**: Must use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` due to peer dependency conflicts

## Current Questions
- What specific AI provider is being used?
- How is the RAG middleware implemented?
- What is the database schema structure?
- How is authentication handled?
- What file types are supported for upload and processing?
- How are conversations stored and retrieved?
- What is the deployment strategy for the application?

## Immediate Tasks
- Complete the memory bank initialization
- Explore key components of the codebase
- Update documentation with findings
- Identify any missing or incomplete aspects of the project

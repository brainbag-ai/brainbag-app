# Progress

## Current Status
- Memory bank initialization in progress
- Initial documentation created based on project structure analysis
- No active development work has been started yet

## What Works
- Memory bank directory structure established
- Core documentation files created:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md
  - progress.md (this file)

## What's Left to Build
- .clinerules file for project intelligence
- Detailed documentation of specific components
- Validation of assumptions made in initial documentation
- Exploration of key codebase elements:
  - AI integration and RAG middleware
  - Database schema and migrations
  - Authentication system
  - Chat interface components
  - File processing utilities

## Known Issues
- Documentation is based on initial analysis and may contain inaccuracies
- Specific implementation details are not yet documented
- Technical assumptions need validation through code exploration
- ~~OIDC token hash library error in middleware (fixed)~~
## Recent Achievements
- Created a command line utility for cleaning up application data:
  - Implemented a TypeScript script (cleanup.ts) to delete chunks, chats, files, and optionally users
  - Added command line options for preserving user accounts and dry run mode
  - Added detailed help documentation for the command
  - Integrated with the existing database and Vercel Blob storage
  - Added as an npm script for easy execution: `npm run cleanup`

- Modified RAG system to store only user messages in chunks table:
  - Updated createMessage function to only add messages to the chunks table if they are from the user (role === 'user')
  - Kept all other functionality intact, including storing both user and assistant messages in the chat record
  - Ensured the RAG system will only use user messages for context retrieval
- Implemented proper embeddings for chat chunk logic:
  - Updated createMessage function to use real embeddings instead of placeholder zeros
  - Modified RAG middleware to use vector similarity search instead of keyword matching
  - Used OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model for consistent embedding generation
  - Added proper error handling for embedding generation
  - Fixed issue with user messages not being saved to the database by updating the chat API route
  - Improved the chat API route to correctly process only the user's new message
  - Fixed a bug where the user's message wasn't being properly stored in the chunk table
  - Enhanced the RAG middleware to retrieve user's chat history even when no files are selected
  - Implemented cross-chat memory by using all user's previous chat chunks for context
  - Ensured both user and assistant messages are properly embedded and stored
  - Noted potential future enhancements: adjustable similarity thresholds, different similarity metrics, and filtering/weighting of chunks based on metadata
- Added user chat messages to the RAG system:
  - Updated database schema to add chatId and userId fields to the chunk table
  - Modified createMessage function to add messages to the chunk table with dummy embeddings
  - Updated RAG middleware to include chat chunks in the relevance calculation
  - Added functions to get chunks by user ID
  - Created manual SQL migration to update the database schema
  - Fixed embedding generation issue by using a placeholder embedding array
  - Successfully applied database schema changes using manual migration
  - Fixed foreign key constraint issue by ensuring chat records exist before adding chunks
- Created memory bank directory
- Established core documentation structure
- Documented initial understanding of project architecture and technologies
- Fixed authentication issues in Next.js middleware:
  - Created a simplified auth implementation that doesn't rely on problematic libraries
  - Updated middleware to avoid Edge Runtime compatibility issues
  - Fixed cookies() usage in Next.js 15 by properly awaiting the Promise
  - Created custom API route handlers for auth endpoints
  - Modified next.config.mjs to add external packages and disable file tracing
  - Successfully resolved all errors and got the application running
- Documented initial understanding of project architecture and technologies
- Fixed middleware error related to OIDC token hash library by excluding authentication routes from Edge Runtime
- Removed next-auth and authentication from the app:
  - Removed next-auth dependency from package.json
  - Removed authentication checks from middleware.ts
  - Updated auth-related API routes to use session-based users
  - Modified the Chat component to work without authentication
  - Removed oidc-token-hash and openid-client from serverExternalPackages
  - Enabled direct access to the chat without login
  - Created utils/constants.ts to share constants between client and server
  - Fixed Node.js module import issues in browser environment
  - Implemented per-session user creation with auto-generated usernames
  - Updated all API routes to use the session ID for user identification
  - Modified client components to pass session ID to API routes
  - Fixed RAG middleware to work with session-based users
  - Updated AI chat to properly retrieve chunks from the database using session ID

## Upcoming Milestones
- Complete memory bank initialization
- Create .clinerules file
- Validate documentation through code exploration
- Update documentation with findings
- Prepare for active development work

## Blockers
- Limited understanding of specific implementation details
- Need to explore codebase to validate assumptions

## Notes
- Initial documentation is based on project structure analysis
- Further exploration will be needed to refine documentation
- The memory bank will evolve as more information is gathered

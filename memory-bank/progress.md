# Progress

## Current Status
- Memory bank initialization in progress
- Initial documentation created based on project structure analysis
- No active development work has been started yet

## What Works
- Memory bank directory structure established
- Core documentation files created:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md
  - progress.md (this file)

## What's Left to Build
- .clinerules file for project intelligence
- Detailed documentation of specific components
- Validation of assumptions made in initial documentation
- Exploration of key codebase elements:
  - AI integration and RAG middleware
  - Database schema and migrations
  - Authentication system
  - Chat interface components
  - File processing utilities

## Known Issues
- Documentation is based on initial analysis and may contain inaccuracies
- Specific implementation details are not yet documented
- Technical assumptions need validation through code exploration
- ~~OIDC token hash library error in middleware (fixed)~~
## Recent Achievements
- Created memory bank directory
- Established core documentation structure
- Documented initial understanding of project architecture and technologies
- Fixed authentication issues in Next.js middleware:
  - Created a simplified auth implementation that doesn't rely on problematic libraries
  - Updated middleware to avoid Edge Runtime compatibility issues
  - Fixed cookies() usage in Next.js 15 by properly awaiting the Promise
  - Created custom API route handlers for auth endpoints
  - Modified next.config.mjs to add external packages and disable file tracing
  - Successfully resolved all errors and got the application running
- Documented initial understanding of project architecture and technologies
- Fixed middleware error related to OIDC token hash library by excluding authentication routes from Edge Runtime

## Upcoming Milestones
- Complete memory bank initialization
- Create .clinerules file
- Validate documentation through code exploration
- Update documentation with findings
- Prepare for active development work

## Blockers
- Limited understanding of specific implementation details
- Need to explore codebase to validate assumptions

## Notes
- Initial documentation is based on project structure analysis
- Further exploration will be needed to refine documentation
- The memory bank will evolve as more information is gathered
